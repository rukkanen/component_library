## Dimensions
The length of the robot car is approximately 30cm, providing a compact yet functional size for its intended purpose.

## Sensor Integration
The structure of the car includes designated spaces to mount sensors. These sensors play a crucial role in gathering data and enabling the car to interact with its environment effectively.

## Arduino Microcontrollers
Two Arduino microcontrollers are integrated into the car's structure using breadboards. These microcontrollers serve as the brain of the car, controlling its movements and processing sensor data.

Overall, the physical structure of the robot car is carefully designed to house the necessary components, ensuring optimal functionality and performance.
